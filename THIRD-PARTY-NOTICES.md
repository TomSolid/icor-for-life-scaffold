# Third-party notices

## Bundled community plugins

The ICOR for Life Scaffold bundles one unmodified community plugin for
Obsidian so the vault works out of the box. It is a separate work by
its own author, distributed under its own license, aggregated here for
convenience:

| Plugin | Author | Version bundled | License | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Outliner | Viacheslav Slinko | 4.10.2 | MIT | https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner |

The full license text ships inside the plugin's folder under
`.obsidian/plugins/`. The complete corresponding source code is
available at the linked repository.

This plugin is listed in Obsidian's official community catalog. After
first open, run Settings -> Community plugins -> Check for updates to
move to the latest official version; Obsidian's updater recognizes the
bundled copy normally.

Until Scaffold 1.6.0 the vault also bundled the third-party Terminal
plugin by polyipseity (AGPL-3.0). From 1.7.0 the shell inside the app is
**ICOR for Life - Terminal**, our own plugin, listed below.

## Components inside the ICOR plugins

The ICOR plugins are our own work. Several of them bundle no
third-party code at all: ICOR Focus, ICOR Interface and myICOR Connect are
hand-written JavaScript against the Obsidian plugin API.

**ICOR Planner** embeds the source-tool glyphs (Todoist, ClickUp) as SVG
path data from the Simple Icons project (https://simpleicons.org),
released under CC0 1.0 Universal. The brand marks themselves remain
subject to their owners' trademark policies.

**ICOR Chat** bundles the Claude Agent SDK for TypeScript
(`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`), published by Anthropic, version
0.3.226, from https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript.
The SDK is not open source. Its package declares its license as "SEE
LICENSE IN README.md", and that README places use of the SDK under
Anthropic's Commercial Terms of Service, at
https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms.

The Claude Code binary is NOT bundled or redistributed. ICOR Chat runs the
copy of Claude Code already installed on your own machine, unmodified, and
you sign in to it with your own Anthropic account through Anthropic's own
sign-in flow. The plugin never collects, stores, or relays your
credentials, and your Claude usage is billed to you under your own
agreement with Anthropic. myICOR is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
partnered with Anthropic.

Two open-source libraries are bundled alongside the SDK. Their notices
follow in full:

**ICOR SQLite Viewer** bundles sql.js (a WebAssembly build of SQLite,
MIT License, https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js) as its mobile and
fallback engine; SQLite itself is public domain. The full notice ships
in the plugin's own `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`. The desktop engine is the
`sqlite3` command line tool already on the member's machine, which is
not bundled or redistributed.

**ICOR Terminal** bundles the xterm.js terminal emulator and five of its
addons, all by The xterm.js authors and all under the MIT License, from
https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js:

| Component | Version | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@xterm/xterm` | 6.0.0 | the terminal emulator, rendering and input; its `css/xterm.css` is included in `styles.css` with its license header |
| `@xterm/addon-fit` | 0.11.0 | sizing the grid to the pane |
| `@xterm/addon-search` | 0.16.0 | the find bar |
| `@xterm/addon-web-links` | 0.12.0 | clickable URLs in output |
| `@xterm/addon-unicode11` | 0.9.0 | correct width of Unicode 11 characters, including emoji |
| `@xterm/addon-webgl` | 0.19.0 | the WebGL renderer where the graphics stack allows it |

Copyright (c) 2017-2019, The xterm.js authors (MIT). Copyright (c)
2014-2016, SourceLair Private Company (MIT). Copyright (c) 2012-2013,
Christopher Jeffrey (MIT). The MIT License text is the same one
reproduced above under Zod. The full notice, with each component listed,
ships in the plugin's own `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.

The plugin's pseudo-terminal helper (shipped inside `main.js` as readable
Python source) uses only the Python 3 standard library. Python itself is
NOT bundled or redistributed; the plugin runs the `python3` already
installed on the member's machine, which is a prerequisite on macOS and
Linux (see `README.md`). Lucide icon names are resolved through
Obsidian's own API at runtime; no icon assets are bundled.

No copyleft-licensed code (GPL, LGPL, AGPL or MPL) is bundled inside any
ICOR plugin, and from Scaffold 1.7.0 no copyleft component ships in this
vault at all.

Obsidian itself is NOT bundled or redistributed; users install it from
obsidian.md under Obsidian's own terms.
