"""test-link-dates-to-daily-notes.py: the red tests for GL-1011's guard.

Builds a throwaway vault in a temp folder, one fixture per rule the script
claims, and asserts the script says what it claims. GL-1005 rule 4: a gate
nobody has watched go red is not a gate, so every IGNORE fixture here is a
date the script must NOT touch, and the suite fails if it touches one.

Run it with --break-me to prove the suite itself can go red: it flips one
assertion's expectation and the run must end in FAIL.

Usage:  test-link-dates-to-daily-notes.py [--break-me]
Exit 0 = every case held. Exit 1 = a case did not.
