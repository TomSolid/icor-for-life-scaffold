"""test-life-snapshot.py: the fixture suite behind life-snapshot.py.

Builds a throwaway vault in a temp folder, one fixture per rule the script
claims, and asserts the script says what it claims. Every negative control
here is a signal the score must NOT count (a session log, an mtime, a
processed scratchpad counted twice), and the suite fails if the score moves.

Run it with --break-me to prove the suite itself can go red: it asserts the
opposite of one held rule and the run must end in FAIL.

Usage:  test-life-snapshot.py [--break-me]
Exit 0 = every case held. Exit 1 = a case did not.
