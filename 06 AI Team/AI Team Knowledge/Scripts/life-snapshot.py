"""Answer the six everyday life questions from ONE regenerated file.

Usage:
  life-snapshot.py [<vault-root>] [--json] [--write] [--brief]

  (no flag)  the same short brief a person reads, on stdout
  --json     the whole snapshot on stdout, for a machine
  --write    the snapshot to .icor-for-life/scripts/snapshot.json, which the
             session-start hook, the skill prerun and the AI Chat plugin read
  --brief    the short brief only (about 20 lines), for the hook

The six questions: my goals, the projects I should focus on, my weekly
priorities, my highlight today, my key elements, the topics with my recent attention.
Five of the six are a script answer. The sixth (focus) is a script reading a
decision the user made and stored as `focus_rank`; this script never decides
which projects are in focus and never picks a highlight.

check-quality.py answers "is what is in the vault any good". This answers
"what is in my life right now". Two questions, two scripts, on purpose.

Runs in BOTH vaults. The private vault stores foreign keys as slugs and the
public one as quoted wikilinks; FIELDS below carries both spellings of every
field name and the resolver accepts both value shapes, so there is one script
and no per-vault branch beyond that one dict.

The report shape is schema 1, documented in Scripts/README.md, and is a
contract with its readers: field names and order do not change inside a
schema version.

Exit 0 = a snapshot was produced (read `degraded` before trusting a gap).
Exit 1 = refused: the path is not a vault root, the file cannot be written,
or a secret-shaped value would have been written. A missing report is never
a green: an absent file means the script did not run, never that the user
has no goals.
