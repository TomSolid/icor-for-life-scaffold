#!/bin/bash
# Build a distribution zip of the ICOR for Life Scaffold that can NEVER
# contain personal data or API tokens, and can never contain an artifact
# whose version number disagrees with the bytes that number names.
#
# How safety is guaranteed:
#   1. The vault is never zipped directly. The scaffold content comes from
#      `git archive` of the scaffold repo: only tracked files ship, and
#      .env / workspace.json / our plugin folders (whose data.json holds
#      tokens) are gitignored, so they cannot be tracked.
#   2. The ICOR plugins and the INKLINE theme are added from their own
#      repos via `git archive` too, BY PATH: a plugin folder gets main.js,
#      manifest.json and styles.css, the theme gets manifest.json and
#      theme.css, and nothing else in those repos (sources, tests, their
#      own release workflows) can reach the zip. Those repos gitignore
#      data.json, and the shape is asserted again in the residue gate.
#   3. A secret scan runs over the staged tree and aborts on any hit.
#   4. THE ARTIFACT GATE: every bundled plugin and the theme is compared,
#      byte for byte, against the assets of its latest published GitHub
#      release. A version number is not evidence; the digest is.
#   5. THE RESIDUE GATE: this script and the release workflow that runs it
#      are our build tooling. They name our local mirror paths, our output
#      directory and our GitHub org, so they are a map of our internals and
#      they have no use to a member. Both are dropped from the staged tree
#      by exact path, and then an independent scan that knows nothing about
#      those paths fails the build if any of their fingerprints survive
#      anywhere in the tree. Removal alone would be silent filtering; the
#      scan is what makes a rename go red.
#      The zip is only written after every gate passes.
#   6. THE ZIP IS REPRODUCIBLE: every entry carries the staged commit's
#      timestamp and the entries are written in one fixed order, so the same
#      tag with the same plugin releases gives the same bytes. The release
#      workflow relies on this: a re-run compares its zip with the asset
#      already published under that version instead of overwriting it.
#
# Why gate 4 exists. Three times a correct version number sat on top of the
# wrong bytes, and each time a person caught it, not a check:
#   - a plugin's manifest read 0.6.1 while its newest release was 0.4.2.
#   - the theme shipped tag 1.2.4 and a main that differed by 2,037 bytes
#     of CSS, both called 1.2.4, while it was live in the community
#     directory. Every version number agreed. Only the bytes disagreed.
#   - a test vault held a folder labelled 0.1.0 whose bytes were not 0.1.0.
# This script stages seven of the nine artifacts with `git archive main`
# (by path), so without gate 4 the next unbumped commit to any of them
# silently re-creates that defect inside the zip, where nobody is looking
# at git.
#
# Usage: bash build-release-zip.sh [output-dir]   (default: ~/Desktop)
#
# Environment (every one optional; the defaults are the local maintainer setup):
#   ICOR_SCAFFOLD_TAG     stage this exact tag of the scaffold instead of
#                         origin/main. The release workflow sets it to the
#                         version it just tagged, so what ships is the tagged
#                         tree and nothing that landed on main after it. The
#                         tag must exist on the remote and its VERSION must
#                         equal the tag name.
#   ICOR_SCAFFOLD_GIT     the scaffold's bare mirror (default: the mirror
#                         beside the plugin mirrors). Created if missing.
#   ICOR_SCAFFOLD_REMOTE  where that mirror fetches from (default: the public
#                         scaffold repository). A local dry run points both of
#                         these at a throwaway clone; CI never sets either.

# For every bundled artifact: the staged manifest version must equal the tag
# of that repo's latest published release, and every required asset must be
# byte-identical to the asset published under that tag.
#
# This is the clause that catches the theme shape. Comparing version
# NUMBERS passes when a repo re-uses a number over changed bytes; only the
# digest comparison fails. Note that four of these are staged from `git
# archive main`, so this compares main's bytes against what the world can
# actually download.
#
# A check that cannot run must go RED, never green. Missing digest, missing
# asset, missing release: all block.
