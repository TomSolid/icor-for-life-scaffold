"""Open a vault file in Obsidian, in a new tab.

GL-1005: opening files is deterministic, so a script does it. Used by the
WS-1003 guided tour (and any agent that wants to put a note in front of
the user).

Usage:
    python3 open-in-obsidian.py "path/inside/vault.md" [more paths ...]
    python3 open-in-obsidian.py --dry-run "path.md"   # print, don't open

Resolution order:
  1. The official Obsidian CLI (`obsidian open path=... newtab`) - the
     preferred path; opens in a new tab without stealing focus rules.
  2. The obsidian:// URI, handed to the OS: `os.startfile` on Windows,
     `open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux - works everywhere Obsidian is
     installed, but cannot force a new tab. When this fallback is used,
     stdout carries a RECOMMEND line: suggest the official Obsidian CLI
     to the user (Obsidian installer 1.12.7+, https://help.obsidian.md/cli).

Exit codes: 0 opened (or dry-run) - 2 file not in the vault - 3 no way
to open Obsidian found.
