"""Build .icor-for-life/manifest.json, the machine-readable description of
THIS version of the ICOR for Life Scaffold.

Usage:
  build-scaffold-manifest.py            -> (re)write .icor-for-life/manifest.json
  build-scaffold-manifest.py --check    -> exit 1 if the manifest on disk is stale
                                           or a removal has no changelog line,
                                           or a note has an empty name in it
  build-scaffold-manifest.py --check --upstream <myPKA checkout>
                                        -> also: every `vendored` file equals its
                                           upstream file in that checkout

THE SPLIT (plan step 12, 2026-09-24). This repo is the content half; myPKA
is the team half, and in mode A both are unpacked into one folder. What
changed here, and why:
  - VERSION may carry a pre-release tag (2.0.0-lab); tags, history and the
    changelog sections sort by semver precedence (2.0.0-lab < 2.0.0).
  - `files` is a map path -> sha256, the shape the updater (myPKA
    mypka-update.py) and the disjoint check read. The version folder is
    hashed too; the manifest's own entry is the literal "self".
  - `repo_only` holds the tracked files that never reach a member (the zip's
    RESIDUE_PATHS plus .gitignore, placement row 9), with their hashes.
  - `seed` lists shipped files that are the member's after the first install
    (.obsidian/workspace.json, which Obsidian rewrites): the updater adds
    them when missing and never overwrites them. Formerly EXCLUDE.
  - `previous` maps a path to the sha256 of every older byte-state it had at
    an earlier tag: the updater overwrites only bytes a release shipped.
  - `previous_removed` (idea: Brian Carroll, @brijcarroll) is the same for
    the paths this release no longer ships: a path that `history` removes or
    renames away (not a move to myPKA) maps to the sha256 of every byte-state
    it had at an earlier tag that no `history` entry for it already names.
    `history` keeps only the last shipped hash, so without this an untouched
    copy of an older version reads as the member's own file. Only paths
    with such an extra hash are listed. A reader takes the union of this
    list and the path's `history` hashes; one that does not know the key
    ignores it and keeps its old answer.
  - NO `agents` list. The contracts live in myPKA now, and so does the list
    (build-mypka-manifest.py). Reading 06 AI Team/Agents from here found
    nothing in a sibling layout and a different product's files in mode A.
  - step 13 (Flint's step 14 preconditions, Marshall M2): `schema` is 2;
    `examples` lists the shipped example notes; a `history` removal that the
    myPKA manifest under --upstream ships is marked `moved_to: "mypka"` (with
    no --upstream the marks are carried from the manifest on disk) and needs
    no changelog line; `previous` holds only paths this release ships; tags
    may carry a leading v.
  - carried, never computed: name, implements, exposes, tools, vendored,
    source_commit, retired_ids. They are declared in the manifest by a person (step 3 and
    step 10) and kept across rebuilds; the tools and vendored paths are
    validated against `files`, and a vendored file's hash against its pin.

What the manifest is for. A member's vault is a copy of one version of this
repo with their own content grown on top. The Scaffold Check plugin reads the
manifest of the LATEST version and compares it with what the vault holds, so it
can tell the member three things a version number alone cannot:
  - which canonical files are missing, which they changed, and which changed
    upstream since they installed (three different answers, three different
    actions);
  - which files were REMOVED or MOVED upstream after their version and are
    still sitting in their vault (the CSS snippets that moved into the theme
    are the founding example);
  - whether the structure still holds: the rooms, the enabled plugins, every
    Base pointing at a folder that exists.

Everything in here is deterministic (GL-1005). The one piece of judgement, WHY
a file was removed and where it went, lives as prose in CHANGELOG.md; this
script only carries that line across into the manifest and refuses, under
--check, to describe a removal the changelog does not explain.

Sources of truth, none of them duplicated here:
  version   .icor-for-life/VERSION (one line, hand-bumped)
  rooms     the REQUIRED list in validate-scaffold.py (read via ast, not copied)
  plugins   .obsidian/community-plugins.json (the icor-for-life-* ids)
  snippets  .obsidian/appearance.json enabledCssSnippets
  files     `git ls-files`: every tracked file, shipped ones in `files`,
            the RESIDUE_PATHS the zip builder strips (read via regex from
            build-release-zip.sh, not copied) in `repo_only`
  history   `git diff --name-status -M` between consecutive tags
  previous  the blobs of the same paths at every earlier tag
  previous_removed  the blobs of the removed and renamed-away paths at
            every earlier tag, less the hashes `history` already holds
  notes     .icor-for-life/CHANGELOG.md, the line whose first backticked
            name is the exact path; never one with an empty name in it

Exit 0 = manifest written (or --check passed). Exit 1 = see stderr.
